# **Libraries Used**
pygame: For rendering the chessboard and handling the game loop and animations.
python-chess: For the chess game logic, handling move validation, board state, and FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation).

# **Install the required libraries:**
pip install pygame python-chess
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

# **Other application:
stockfish engine: For hardcore AI download links: https://stockfishchess.org/download/

# **Running the Project**
To run the project, navigate to the directory containing the main game file and run it:
python main.py
This will launch the Pygame window with the chessboard and start the game with AI vs AI.

This project is a Chess game with an AI opponent, built using the Python libraries chess and pygame.
It is designed for academic purposes, demonstrating the use of AI in gaming and visualizing board states in real-time.

# **Purpose**
The main goal of this project is to create a playable Chess game,
implement simple AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.

This project is intended for educational purposes to give an introduction of AI.

# **How It Works**
Chess Logic
The game logic is handled by the python-chess library. 
It provides an easy-to-use API for interacting with the chessboard, making legal moves, and determining the game status (Checkmate, Stalemate, etc.).
